Feel free to improve/optimize example code included.

PHP part:
  1. In /api/events.php you will find 2 sources of data, one article and one hash containing events with markets and outcomes.
  2. Replace article placeholders in article with corresponding EVENT level data.
  3. The returned response should be an JSON object containing finalized article + market level data with outcomes.

JS application:
  1. Make ajax call to /api/events.php to get data.
  2. Sort markets on index
  3. build DOM based on market data as described in index.html
  4. On "Toggle prices" button click, toggle market prices between decimal and fractional. Both is supplied in markets outcome data ((priceNum, priceDen), priceDec).

  Keep the application state out of the DOM.
  Feel free to use whatever external tools/libs you see fit.
